# Multi-hazard
This folder contains GIF maps to express the multi-hazard scenarios based on the time frame and spatial distribution.
Each figure with a caption number on the paper was uploaded and run with the same name in the repositories.
All information had been explained in the GIF to impart meaning and to enable the reader to understand the figure clearly.
This is version 1.
This includes the spatial distribution and timestamps that were created using QGIS.
